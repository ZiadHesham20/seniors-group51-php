    <h1>Compilation vs. Interpretation</h1>
    <p>Compiler and interpreter are two different approaches to executing code in programming languages. Here's a comparison between compiler and interpreter languages:
<br>
1. Compilation vs. Interpretation:
The main difference between compiler and interpreter languages is in how they execute code. A compiler translates the entire program into machine code before executing it, whereas an interpreter executes the code line-by-line, translating each line on-the-fly.
<br>
2. Speed:
Compiled languages are generally faster than interpreted languages because the code is translated into machine code before running, which means that the computer doesn't need to spend time interpreting the code line-by-line during runtime. In contrast, interpreted languages have to translate each line of code during runtime, which can slow down the program.
<br>
3. Portability:
Interpreted languages are generally more portable than compiled languages because the interpreter can be run on any platform that supports the language. In contrast, compiled languages require a separate version of the program to be compiled for each platform it will run on.
<br>
4. Debugging:
Debugging is often easier in interpreted languages because the interpreter can provide immediate feedback on errors as they occur. In contrast, in compiled languages, errors may not be detected until the program is run, which can make debugging more difficult.
<br>
5. Memory management:
Compiled languages generally require manual memory management, whereas interpreted languages often have automatic memory management. This means that in compiled languages, the programmer has to manage memory explicitly, whereas in interpreted languages, the interpreter takes care of memory management for the programmer.

Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, and Java, while examples of interpreted languages include Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.</p>
